Recognizing the growing demand for mobile reading, Lezhin has invested heavily in optimizing its mobile app. The latest updates include faster loading times, reduced lag, and improved offline reading capabilities. Users can now download chapters more efficiently and enjoy a seamless reading experience even without an internet connection.

Furthermore, push notifications for new chapter releases ensure that fans never miss updates from their favorite series.

Expanded Content Library
Lezhin Comics has consistently expanded its library, adding a wide variety of new titles across multiple genres, including romance, fantasy, action, BL (Boys' Love), and GL (Girls' Love). The platform has secured exclusive contracts with renowned creators, ensuring a steady influx of high-quality content. Recent additions include highly anticipated sequels and spin-offs of popular series, as well as original works from emerging artists. Lezhin has also increased its focus on diversifying its offerings by including more international comics, broadening its appeal to a global audience.

Improved Monetization and Pricing Models
To make its content more accessible, Lezhin has introduced flexible pricing models and frequent promotional events. Users can now purchase coins (the platform‚Äôs currency) at discounted rates during special sales, and some series offer free episodes for a limited time. Additionally, Lezhin has implemented a "Wait-for-Free" feature, allowing readers to unlock chapters over time without spending coins. These changes aim to balance profitability with user satisfaction, ensuring that both casual readers and dedicated fans can enjoy the platform without financial strain.

Creator Support and Revenue Sharing
